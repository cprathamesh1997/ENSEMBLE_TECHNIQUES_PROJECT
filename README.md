## Analysis Of Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Patients Using Ensemble Techniques

Abstract:
Breast cancer represents one of the diseases that make a high number of deaths every year. It is the most common type of all cancers and the main cause of women's deaths worldwide. Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data. Especially in the medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.

Problem Statement:

This project aims to classify whether a patient has breast cancer or not based on the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass using ensembling techniques like 'Bagging meta-estimator', 'AdaBoost', and 'XGBoost'. The dataset consists of several predictor variables and one target variable, Diagnosis, which has values 'Benign' and 'Malignant'.
Benign: These tumors are not cancerous. They do not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body. If a doctor removes them, they do not generally return.
Malignant: Malignant tumors are cancerous. The cells can grow and spread to other parts of the body.
Before building the model, necessary exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the data and identify any patterns or trends that could be useful for modeling.The performance of the model is evaluated based on performance metrics other than model accuracy.
