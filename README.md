# ENSEMBLE_TECHNIQUES_PROJECT
## Analysis Of Breast Cancer in Patients Using Ensemble Techniques

This project aims to classify whether a patient has breast cancer or not based on the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass using ensembling techniques like 'Bagging meta-estimator', 'AdaBoost', and 'XGBoost'. The dataset consists of several predictor variables and one target variable, Diagnosis, which has values 'Benign' and 'Malignant'. Before building the model, necessary exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the data and identify any patterns or trends that could be useful for modeling.The performance of the model is evaluated based on performance metrics other than model accuracy.
